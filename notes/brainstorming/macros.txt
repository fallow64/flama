Since code space is limited in DF, it is very important that the least amount of codespace is used.

Instead of creating a class for things like strings or numbers, a type of macro system should be added
in order to simplify the creation of what should be very little actual blocks.

Perhaps something like this?:
```

macro name(a: typ1, b: typ1 | typ2) {

}

```
